Welcome to my website! I am currently a master student in GIScience at Nanjing Normal University, and a member of the [Open Geographic Modeling and Simulation (OpenGMS)](https://geomodeling.njnu.edu.cn/) Lab advised by [Prof. Min Chen](http://schools.njnu.edu.cn/geog/person/min-chen). I received my B.Sc degree in GIScience with first class honor from [Nantong University (NTU)](https://en.ntu.edu.cn/), China in 2020. I am interested in the philosophy of combining geospatial technologies (GIS and Remote Sensing) with artificial intelligence technologies, aiming at developing innovative approaches to solving problems in a variety of domains, including ecology, environment, urban, energy, etc. On this website you can find my {{< staticref "uploads/ZhenQian_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}}, recent news, publications and information on the software I have developed.
